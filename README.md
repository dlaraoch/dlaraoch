## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p> My name is Deisy Lara, and Iâ€™m a UX/UI Designer based in San Francisco, CA. Growing up as a first generation LatinX with a learning disability, I have cultivated a special interest in diversity, inclusivity, and accessible design for all. By streamlining a userâ€™s journey in ways others havenâ€™t thought about, we can make a huge impact in peopleâ€™s daily lives. All it takes is having that different perspective to conduct unique research and data analysis. This is where I step in.


Through my own trials over the years, I have learned and developed an innate ability to know what to look for and what questions to ask to get to the root of the problem. As a UX designer, I draw on this ability in every step of my process to ensure differently-abled members of the population are not overlooked. Additionally, my collaborative nature makes me easy to work with while my sense of initiative means I thrive in fast-paced environments.


When Iâ€™m not researching and designing, Iâ€™m out catching waves in Santa Cruz or crushing it on my favorite board game, Catan. Iâ€™m always looking for new people to play with!</p>
